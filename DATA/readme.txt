Loan Assessment LOGS version 0.1
by A. Maaradji, M. Dumas, M. La Rosa and A. Ostovar

This archive contains 72 synthetic logs related to different variants of a Loan Assessment process which was first documented in Dumas, M., La Rosa, M., Mendling, J., Reijers, H.A.: Fundamentals of Business Process Management. Springer (2013). 

The variants of this process have been created by first applying the change patterns documented in Weber, B., Reichert, M., Rinderle-Ma, S.: Change patterns and change supportfeatures–enhancing flexibility in process-aware information systems. Data & knowl-edge engineering 66(3) (2008), and then simulating executions of each of these variants using the BIMP simulator (http://bimp.cs.ut.ee).
